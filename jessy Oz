We mentioned that with future context, we can talk about the future using the
present. For example, we had tomorrow, which was. Manana. Manana. Good we had later or more late which was. Mas tarde. Mas tarde. We had tonight or this night. Esta noche
Esta noche, good. Another one is pronto. Pronto. What do you think pronto
means?
Now. “Ahora” was now. No. Soon. Soon. Yeah. You hear an English sometimes. Get here pronto. No, it's get
here soon. So “pronto” is also future context. What was the verb to see or to
view?
”Ver” He sees. Ve
Good, they?
Ven
You informal. Ves
We?
Vemos
Very good. The “I” version is a tiny bit irregular. It's veo, veo, so you
have “v-e-o” or “b-e-o”. So it's not va as it should be or it was too short. It
became veo, v-e-o. How would you say I'm seeing her later? I'm seeing her
later. Veo ella mas tarde. That means. I see she later. It's not la. It is
Also it is la veo. La veo. Good. . Yes la veo mas tarde. La veo mas tarde. I am seeing her tonight. La veo. Esta noche. Good. We are seeing her soon. We are seeing her soon. La Venomos, pronto. What is to see?
Oh, sorry. It should be vemos. Yes. So no guessing. No guessing at all. It's the only one, huh?
La vemos, pronto. Good. La vemos, pronto. What if we say we're seeing, We will see them soon. But with this them we mean a female group. We're seeing them soon. Las vemos pronto. Good. Las vemos, pronto. He is seeing them soon. And this time they are still
females. He is seeing them soon. Las ve pronto. Good. And you informal.
La ves pronto. Them soon you're seeing them. Las ves pronto. Good. Make it a question. Are you seeing them soon? The female “them”. ¿Las ves pronto?
¿Las ves pronto? Aren't you seeing them soon?
¿No las ves pronto? No las ves pronto? Why aren't you seeing them soon?
¿Por qué no las ves pronto?
Good. Por qué no las ves pronto? Very good. So we saw that with future
context we don't need the future. If we don't have future context, we can still
use the present to talk about the future. Using this, I go, I'm going, which is
present, but we can use it to talk about the future in Spanish as we do in
English. I'm going to see her. We're talking about the future. We are going to
see her, so let's practice that. How would you say we are going to see her?
Vamos a ver la. Are you going to see him soon? Speaking informally. Are you going to see
him soon? So you can't work with “ir” which is to go. You should probably
work with “vamos” and work backwards. Vas. Good. ¿Vas a ver lo pronto?
Good. ¿Vas a ver lo pronto? The word for us is “nos”. “Nos”. So how would
you say? Are you going to see “us” soon? Are you going to see “us” soon?
And we still speaking “informally”. ¿Vas a ver nos pronto?
Very good ¿Vas a ver nos pronto? Where else could that “no”go?
At the beginning. Before the changed verb. ¿Nos vas a ver pronto? Very good. ¿Nos vas a ver pronto? Aren't you going to see us soon?
¿No vas a ver pronto? ?Nos pronto?
Good. ¿No vas a ver nos pronto¿ or ¿No nos vas a ver pronto¿ Either way, why aren't you going to see us soon?
¿Por qué no vas a ver nos pronto¿
Good. So we've seen that we can use the present to talk about the future
using going to or also using future context. Word like tomorrow. Next week. Next
week is the week that comes and the week is La Semana. La Semana. How do
you say
the week that comes? So what is the word for that? Which is the same as
what?
Qué. Last Semana. Qué the week that the week which comes and here we mean the
week comes. So it's it comes so what is it comes.
